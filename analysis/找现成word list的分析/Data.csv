Examples Luke Sargent ‏@lsargent02 ""Still waiting for the A7s I want a camera that is small enough for me to carry around all the time.” Purchase Intent: High; Item: camera Dani ‏@DaniCarbert17 ""Well, lost my phone so if anyone needs to get a hold of me inbox me or in an emergency text Joce LOL” Purchase Intent: Medium; Item: phone Your solution Describe the algorithms, process, etc. for inspecting tweets and classifying those with Purchase Intent. What is the pipeline for ingesting, filtering, classifying, analyzing (and any other steps that come to mind) incoming tweets? Suggest tools that could be used for each of these steps. Make suggestions to maximize scalability & throughput How would you design visualizations so that management can make an informed decision on whether it is worth investing in an advertising tool which targets Twitter users who express Purchase Intent? This could include things like percentage of tweets with PI, specific products which are more likely to be purchased, etc."

What kind of information / data would you look for, how would you use it? - You want to buy a TV on amazon.com. How do you make a decision? - You performed A/B testing on a change in a search engine algorithm. Although in B, the coders made a mistake which led to really poor search results, user clicked on more results as well as on more ads. How do you interpret the results, what do you do next? etc. In total, they look for how you think and approach a problem. They often want to know how you deal with incomplete information, short timelines, trade-offs. Overall, all interviewers were very friendly and professional.

I got disappointed when I asked a question to Senior Manager about the company and I got a very bad response. I asked about different projects which they are working on so that I could get a better understanding about Data Science use cases and the Senior manager did not give a professional reply and stated that 'This should not be your concern.' There were other questions as well where I felt that Senior Manager is being very rude to the interviewee. Apart from this all the other interviewers were very warm and kind.

Uber," The interviews, as I recall: (1) Someone from finance department, covering collaboration w/ members outside of the core group. (2) Hiring manager asked questions around behavioral and problem solving approach; critical thinking; fit for team and group. (3) Product manager asked questions on product intuition and product impact. Being able to connect the problems you’re solving back to the business. Are you able to communicate with a non-technical audience. Some questions about metrics. (4) Coding -- one data manipulation question using Python or R. Could have used SQL to answer it as well. One algorithm/data structure question which honestly isn't really relevant to what someone w/ a statistical modeling background does, but seems to be included these days nonetheless. (5) Data science interview -- met with data scientist team leader who asked questions regarding how to define a given data science problem, what kind of metrics to use, models you'd consider using to answer such questions, etc. Some of the questions were experimental in nature, others were more machine-learning-esque. Of the latter category, would have been beneficial to at least be aware of online learning techniques and perhaps some time series models given the temporal nature of the data. (6) Interview with person not on the same team as the group I interviewed with. This person was supposed to ask me to explain my research and projects and experience according to the recruiter, but wound up just asking me questions about their own work, unexpectedly."

AmericanExpress," Classic stuff about your experience and some examples of relevant projects (for the phone interview) maybe a little bit of model stuff like why you chose specific models. They didn't seem happy with my answer of ""I choose the easiest thing to implement first"" and carried on trying to wrangle a more data scientist-y answer like ""A decision tree seemed to mathematically fit the feature space better"", which is fine if you want to make sure people understand model basics then ask it directly rather than try to direct them into a weird, non-truthful narrative of what happened on the job. In person, 3 hour interview all on model specifics. Asked a lot about maths. I think these are all fine, depending on the role you're applying for. Personally, I'm more of a full stack DS person and by focusing so much on the models and the maths behind the models, it was an odd interview for a role that I assume ultimately was applied DS rather than research DS. Or maybe it truly was a research based role and the questions were appropriate. The fact that I still can't tell says a lot about how unclear the role description was and about the confusion from the hiring manager about what they wanted. That's a red flag."

There were actually a junior and a senior engineer. The junior engineer was just listening in, and the interview was dominated by the senior guy. It probably was partly my fault, but the senior guy asking the question was unable to communicate clearly what he was asking and eventually became preachy and arrogant. 3.)

CivisAnalytics, Required to work through a coding question on a white board
GeneralAssembly," This should be completed in no more than 3 hours. 1. When would I use a Python dictionary to store data, instead of another data structure? Python Dictionary can be used to store data when the data consist of key-value pairs . It also helps in data lookups. 2. When writing Python code, why would you write a function? Functions are define for the purposes of computations and code re-usability 3. I have a Python list named mylist. What is the difference between `sorted(mylist)` and `mylist.sort()`? With sorted(mylist) : Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order. And with mylist.sort() : Returns None because it is not iterable. 4. I have a Pandas DataFrame named users. One of the Series is named age. I run this code: `users[users.age > 25]`. What does this code return, and how does it ""work""? The code selects the ages column and filter out all ages greater than 25 based on the users DataFrame object. 5. What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram? Histogram shows the distributions of some variables whiles bar plot is used to compare variables with respect to a certain descriptive statistics. 6. What is the difference between regression and classification problems, and how can you convert a regression problem into a classification problem? Regression problem is the one that predicts some continuous variable whiles classification problem is the one that predicts some binary or multi-class variable. You can convert a regression problem into a classification problem by adding a binary or multi-class response variable to the independent variables. But if you decide not to add a binary or multi-class response variable you can apply clustering technique like Kmeans on the data to make it a classification problem. 7. When Netflix predicts the number of stars that you will use to rate a movie, are they solving a regression or classification problem? They are solving a classification problem since the ratings are in the range of 1-5 stars. 8. What's wrong with training and testing a machine learning model on the same data? It is important not to test the prediction of an estimator on the data used to fit the estimator as this would not be evaluating the performance of the estimator on new data. This is why datasets are often split into train and test data. 9. What is the purpose of model evaluation procedures that ""hold out"" data, like train/test split and cross-validation? The purpose of the “hold out” like train/test split is used to prevent the introduction of bias into the model and hence Over-Fitting. 10. What are a few metrics (single numbers) I might use to evaluate how well a regression model is doing? R-Square, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error 11. Why is a confusion matrix useful for evaluating the performance of a classifier? The diagonal elements represent the number of points for which the predicted label is equal to the true label, while off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the classifier. The higher the diagonal values of the confusion matrix the better, indicating many correct predictions. It also helps to determine the True positives, False Negative, True Negative etc. 12. I built a machine learning model to solve a binary classification problem. The accuracy of my classifier is 99%, and the AUC is 0.51. Is my model doing well? Why or why not? The model is not doing well because the AUC is about 0.51, which means that the classifier is not able to differentiate between the labels, hence a random classifier. The higher the AUC, the better the model and vice versa. However, the AUC is computed with the prediction scores specified as a parameter in the AUC method. 13. With regard to machine learning models, why should I care the about bias-variance trade-off? We should care because bias introduces under-fitting into the model whiles variance introduces over-fitting into the model, so we need to worry about this issue so that our model can generalize well to unseen data. 14. How does regularization reduce overfitting? Regularization reduce over-fitting by penalizing the parameters in the model as a result of using L1 or L2 penalty regularization terms. When we add a regularization term to the loss function, we shrink the weights a little, increasing the bias while reducing variance. 15. What are a few advantages and disadvantages of decision trees, as compared to other machine learning models? Advantages of Decision Trees: Disadvantages of Decision Trees: "

Facebook," Very disappointing experience from interviewing with FB. Absolute worst and least professional interviewer I have ever had. * FB does video interviews for the first round (along with coding in an online environment). This is fairly surprising since it can't serve much legitimate purpose. I'm sure their legal team is thrilled at the additional burden they face in discrimination lawsuits since the interviewer clearly can has information about the appearance of the candidate and they can't plead ignorance. Of course perhaps they are looking for unkempt candidates or trying to demonstrate the culture of transparency at Facebook, but read on! * Interview was 5 minutes late to video interview and had disheveled appearance during whole interview. He was constantly fidgeting and playing with the neighboring chairs and objects on the table and even put his feet on the other chairs and table! An interview for a position is a two-way street, so the interviewer also needs to be on ""best behavior"". * In addition to the behavior above which was unprofessional, he interrupted very frequently. This goes beyond steering the conversation. This is really tricky since one person is judging you, nobody wants to say ""Please allow me to finish explaining my answer and reasoning"" and hope somebody like this won't hold it against you. He possibly spent just as much time talking as I did during the interview answering his questions. The interruptions came both in the coding sections when I explained my thought process before implementing it and during the product questions when explaining possible scenarios. Of course clarifying comments are helpful to make sure the candidate is on the right track, but interrupting somebody just because they want to use a subquery (and you wouldn't) and is going to solve the problem slightly differently than you would is indicative of your lack of emotional intelligence and perhaps also the programming language you're working with. * He obviously wasn't paying attention during the process and didn't take it seriously. He was constantly working on his computer. Of course he could have been taking notes, but after I answered a question twice and explained my thoughts twice, he stated what the correct answer was--which was in fact what I said twice, but he apparently hadn't been listening then and was occupied with the chair/table objects/computer. * The interviewer seemed to only accept very specific answers that aligned with his thoughts and preferred answers. This mentality is obviously horrible for open-ended questions like ""what could be causing this"" or ""what data would you look at"". You may be looking at this data all the time and know which fields are useful for this task, but when you condescendingly react like the interviewee is a complete idiot for thinking of looking at the timestamp patterns for app usage you don't demonstrate your intelligence but rather your closed mindedness and unfamiliarity and inexperience with working with any type of data except the dataset at your company. * It is probably clear from reading the interview questions from other candidates and what the recruiters provide you as prep, but this really isn't a data scientist position: it's more or a data analyst or SQL monkey position. For this reason I was borderline on interviewing here anyway but thought, ""hey, it is Facebook"". I'm sure everybody in the industry knows that this is what FB data scientists do, so while the name cache might carry advantages when looking for a job later, it could actually harm you if you want to be thought of as a data scientist and move on to legit data scientist/software engineer positions. * The information you receive that you can solve the questions in SQL or Python or R is possibly incorrect. My interviewer wanted it in SQL or Python. Not a big deal since I know all three, but when when this is one of the first things you hear (along with all the rest of the insanity of this interview) it is enough to throw you off your game. SQL seems to be the preferred solution, so I'd recommend forgetting about the others if your SQL is decent. * The one positive of all of this experience is that the recruiters were professional--both in scheduling the interviews and in explaining the role and answering any questions you may have. Overall, I agree with some of the other comments here that you might get unluckly with a very egotistical interviewer. Officially I haven't heard back from FB yet, but I would be shocked to advance and really have no interest to work with someone like this. Bad apples exist in all companies, but a bro culture like this really does dampen any interest of anything FB. Yikes."

(3) Values are given for the market test and you're asked to calculate the profitability of the bank if the marketing plan was implemented. (4) Go-no/go decision at the end."
CapitalOne," The second case was much more complex: (1) Qualitatively analyze two different online application methods--their potential strengths and weaknesses. (2) You're given values and asked to determine which method is more profitable. (3) You're asked to determine if the relationship between the two methods and their respective profit rates are contingent on volume.' (4) Different values are given to you in which case it becomes evident that the profitability of each method varies with volume. (5) You're asked to explain the situation qualitatively--why profitability is changing with volume for the two methods. (6) You're asked to quantitatively determine the volume at which there's a shift in profitability between the two measures. (7) If you're unable to immediately set up the system of equations, the interviewer will ask you to draw out the relationships on a graph. (8) You're asked to determine whether the relationships are linear or nonlinear. If you draw the relationships correctly, you're supposed to be able to determine how to set up the system of equations. (9) Once you figure out the value for Q where the profitability of the two options shift, you're asked to determine a strategy over a specific period of time where you know, before the fact, what the volume will be."
