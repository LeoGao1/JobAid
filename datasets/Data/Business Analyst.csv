(2) You're given values and asked to determine which method is more profitable. (3) You're asked to determine if the relationship between the two methods and their respective profit rates are contingent on volume.' (4) Different values are given to you in which case it becomes evident that the profitability of each method varies with volume. (5) You're asked to explain the situation qualitatively--why profitability is changing with volume for the two methods. (6) You're asked to quantitatively determine the volume at which there's a shift in profitability between the two measures. (7) If you're unable to immediately set up the system of equations, the interviewer will ask you to draw out the relationships on a graph. (8) You're asked to determine whether the relationships are linear or nonlinear. If you draw the relationships correctly, you're supposed to be able to determine how to set up the system of equations.
