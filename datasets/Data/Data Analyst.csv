VisaInc.," Most of the questions were around the resume and my current skill sets. Most of the interview panel was interested to know what I bring to the team/organization. I was also asked to share my thoughts on certain business problems where they wanted to analyze my critical thinking ability. There were also few useless canned questions like ""How does visa make money?"" ""What do you know about Visa?"" ""Teach me something new"" ""best manager/ worst manager you have had"". Nothing that makes you hit a wall. I was given a one liner case study asking me to analyze a certain event that happened in the past. There was no data/business questions/instructions provided. It was basically a very open ended business problem but I did put in a lot of effort into the case study and the panel was very pleased with the insights that I presented. "

Uber," A company called GardenCo makes two drinks, Slurp and Cola. Both sold $6,000,000 last year, while the cost of goods sold for Slurp was $4,000,000 versus $2,000,000 for Cola. The gross margin for Slurp is therefore $2,000,000, and the gross margin for Cola is $4,000,000. The delivery expense last year was equal at $2,400,000 each, while other expenses were $600,000 each, giving a final net income of -$1,000,000 for Slurp and $1,000,000 for Cola.
